<h1>Other things</h1>
<p>
    Brownell is a volunteer at <a href="https://operationspark.org/" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer">Operation Spark</a>, a New Orleans-based non-profit providing free training in software development, mostly to people switching careers.
</p>
<p>Brownell lives on a park where he spends a lot of time walking his dog, Dashiell. He is an avid reader, especially mysteries and history. He has travelled extensively for work and pleasure, and spent the better part of several years sailing in Mexico, Central America, and on the east and west coasts of the United States.</p>
